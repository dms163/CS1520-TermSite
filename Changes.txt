For this final submission I focused mainly on CSS and other behind the scenes changes. 
Firstly, I organized my file structure to something that makes A LOT more sense.
Next, I cleaned up the JavaScript for the Contact Page which I was using the
Javascript (jQuery) to check the form and make sure everything was entered before submitting
IF the required fields were not entered, then a 'model dialog' is created using jQuery to tell the user to please fill out all of the required fields.
OTHERWISE, the javascript code lets the form get submitted
Furthermore, the jQuery code will place the focus to the input that needs to be filled-out.
I corrected this to fix the slip of allowing the form to be submitted.
Next I further stylized my Projects page and refocused the "Panamb" link because I felt it was off center.
I also changed the background color to a soft gray because the squiggles and such of the previous background wasnt amazing.
I changed the picture on the index page to a space image that I had thought was very visualing appeaing yet soft.
I also changed the tab to have a small picture of myself also.
I then added more recent projects to project and reduced the font further to be sure that it was still easily read but there wasnt a scroll bar.
I finished off the projects by changing the link colors to a darker hue of blue.
I then as near final touch added the github and facebook logo with links to each respective site with my profile.
Finally I added a line between the footer and body that is visually appealing.

If there was a third part to the assignment I would have liked to implement the model of web site that the class site was based on. 
I fell in love with the scrolling bar when the user clicked on the tab. This would result in a total rework in my website overall but I think it would be worth it.
I ultimately realized many of the changes I wanted to do would have required this implementation change so I had to find other things I wanted to do. I thouroughly enjoted this project and really capitalized on the oppurtunity to improve my CSS skills.
